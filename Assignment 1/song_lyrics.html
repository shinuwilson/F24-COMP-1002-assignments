    <!--Main song lyrics-->
    <!--First stanza of the song-->
    <p>
        Heart beats fast<br>
        Colors and promises<br>
        How to be brave?<br>
        How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?<br>
        But watching you stand alone<br>
        All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
    </p>
    <!--transition part -->

    <!--Second stanza of the song-->
    <p>
        I have died every day waiting for you<br>
        Darling, don't be afraid<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more
    </p>
    <!--Third stanza of the song-->
    <p>
        Time stands still<br>
        Beauty in all she is<br>
        I will be brave<br>
        I will not let anything take away<br>
        What's standing in front of me<br>
        Every breath, every hour has come to this
    </p>
    <!-- Repetition of the transition part -->

    </P>

        I have died every day waiting for you<br>
        Darling, don't be afraid<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more
    </p>
    <!--Forth stanza of the song-->
    <p>
        And all along I believed I would find you<br>
        Time has brought your heart to me<br>
        I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
        I'll love you for a thousand more
